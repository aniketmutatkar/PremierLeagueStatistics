# üìä PREMIER LEAGUE ANALYTICS DATABASE - DATA INSPECTION SUMMARY

**Analysis Date:** October 15, 2025
**Notebook:** `ml_project/notebooks/01_exploratory_data_analysis/01a_data_inspection.ipynb`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Inspection Complete (Updated with Multi-Season Analysis)

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Data Quality Score: **80/100** üü¢
**Status:** **GREEN LIGHT** - Data is ready for ML modeling

The database contains 16 seasons of Premier League data with excellent data quality (0% missing data). The structure is unique: **15 historical seasons with end-of-season snapshots (GW 38 only)** and **1 current season with week-by-week progression (GW 3-7)**. One minor "issue" was flagged by the consistency check, but this is a false positive related to the multi-season data structure and does not represent actual data quality problems.

## ‚úÖ DATA QUALITY CHECKS

### **1. Missing Data Analysis (Current Records)**

| Column | Missing % | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| goals | 0.0% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| assists | 0.0% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| minutes_played | 0.0% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| matches_played | 0.0% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| shots | 0.0% | ‚úÖ Perfect |
| passes_completed | 0.0% | ‚úÖ Perfect |

**Result:** ‚úÖ All key columns have 0% missing data - EXCELLENT

---

### **2. Logical Consistency Checks**

#### ‚úÖ **Check 1: Excessive Playing Minutes**
- **Players with minutes > matches √ó 90 + 15:** 0
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED - No unrealistic playing times

#### ‚úÖ **Check 2: Negative Stat Values**
- **Players with negative stats:** 0
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED - No negative values in count columns

#### ‚úÖ **Check 3: Gameweek/Matches Consistency**
- **Squads with gameweek ‚â† matches_played (>2 difference):** 0
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED - Gameweek tracking is consistent

#### ‚úÖ **Check 4: Duplicate Current Records**
- **Players with multiple current records:** 0
- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASSED - No duplicates in current snapshot

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Check 5: Gameweek Consistency per Squad**
- **Squads with inconsistent gameweeks per snapshot:** 20
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è FLAGGED - **False Positive**
- **Explanation:** This check flags 20 squads with 6 gameweek variations per valid_from date. This is EXPECTED behavior because:
  - Historical data: Each squad has multiple seasons with the same valid_from load date
  - Multi-season structure: Same squad appears in 15 historical GW 38 snapshots + 5 current season gameweeks
  - **Not a data quality issue:** This is correct multi-season data structure
  - **Recommendation:** Refine check to group by (squad, season, valid_from) for future analysis

---

### **3. SCD Type 2 Validation**

| Check | Result | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Records with NULL valid_from | 0 | ‚úÖ |
| Historical records without valid_to | 0 | ‚úÖ |
| Current records with valid_to set | 0 | ‚úÖ |
| Records with valid_to < valid_from | 0 | ‚úÖ |

**Result:** ‚úÖ SCD Type 2 tracking is working perfectly

---

## üö® ISSUES FOUND

### **Total Issues:** 1 false positive ‚úÖ

**Issues Breakdown:**
1. ‚úÖ No players with excessive minutes
2. ‚úÖ No negative stat values
3. ‚úÖ No gameweek/matches mismatches
4. ‚úÖ No duplicate current records
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **False Positive:** Gameweek consistency "issue" is expected behavior for multi-season structure

**Note:** The flagged "gameweek consistency issue" (20 squads) is NOT a real data quality problem. It's the expected result of having 16 seasons of data for the same squads with the same load date. The underlying data quality is excellent.

---

## üìä FIXTURES ANALYSIS

### **Match Status**
- **Completed Matches:** 60 (15.8%)
- **Pending Matches:** 320 (84.2%)

**Interpretation:**
- 60 completed matches provide historical outcome data for modeling
- Mostly future fixtures for the 2025-2026 season
- Sufficient labeled data for initial model training

---

## üéØ ML READINESS ASSESSMENT

### **Score Breakdown:**
- **Base Score:** 100
- **Deduction for "gameweek consistency":** -10 (false positive, can be ignored)
- **Deduction for missing data:** -0 (0% missing)

- **REPORTED SCORE:** 80/100
- **ACTUAL SCORE:** 90/100 (ignoring false positive)

### **Traffic Light Assessment:** üü¢ **GREEN LIGHT**

**Interpretation:**

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### **1. DATA TO USE FOR MODELING:**

**Recommended Tables:**
- ‚úÖ `analytics_squads` - Team-level predictions with historical benchmarks
- ‚úÖ `analytics_fixtures` - Match outcome labels (60 completed matches)
- ‚úÖ `analytics_players` - Aggregate by squad for team features
- ‚úÖ `analytics_keepers` - Include in defensive metrics

**Recommended Features:**
- **Current form metrics:** GW 3-7 progression (wins, goals, xG trends)
- **Historical benchmarks:** GW 38 outcomes from 15 prior seasons
- **Team comparisons:** Current performance vs historical final positions
- **Player aggregations:** Top scorers, key players, squad depth

### **2. MODELING APPROACHES:**

**Option A: Final Standings Prediction (Recommended)**
- **Input:** Current GW 7 form and stats
- **Output:** Predicted GW 38 outcome (final position, points, goals)
- **Training Data:** 15 years of GW 38 historical outcomes
- **Validation:** Compare GW 7 ‚Üí GW 38 progression patterns

**Option B: Next Match Prediction**
- **Input:** Current form (GW 7) + opponent quality
- **Output:** Win/Draw/Loss probability for next match
- **Training Data:** 60 completed matches + historical team strength indicators

**Option C: Cross-Sectional Ranking**
- **Input:** Snapshot stats at any given gameweek
- **Output:** Relative team strength rankings
- **Training Data:** All 400 squad records across 16 seasons

### **3. TRAIN-TEST SPLIT STRATEGY:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Do NOT use random shuffle**

**‚úÖ Recommended Approach:**
- **Train:** Seasons 2010-2023 (13 seasons, 260 squad GW 38 records)
- **Validation:** Season 2024 (20 squad GW 38 records)
- **Test:** Season 2025 (current GW 7 ‚Üí predict GW 38)

**Alternative: Leave-One-Season-Out Cross-Validation**
- Train on 14 seasons, validate on 1 held-out season
- Repeat for all 15 historical seasons
- Test on current 2025-2026 season

**Why?**
- Respects temporal structure
- Prevents data leakage
- Accounts for season-to-season variations

### **4. FEATURE ENGINEERING PRIORITIES:**

**Tier 1: Current Form (GW 3-7)**
- Goals per game trend
- Wins/losses/draws progression
- xG performance (actual vs expected)
- Recent match outcomes

**Tier 2: Historical Quality Indicators**
- Average GW 38 finishing position (past 5 seasons)
- Historical final goals/points
- Season-to-season consistency

**Tier 3: Player-Level Aggregations**
- Top scorer goals
- Squad depth (number of contributors)
- Key player minutes
