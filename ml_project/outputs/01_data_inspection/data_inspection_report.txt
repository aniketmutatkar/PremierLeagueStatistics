  - Missing Data: -0 (minimal missing data)
  - Limited Historical Progression: -10 (only GW 38, not full season)

✅ GREEN LIGHT: Data is ready for ML modeling

SECTION 7: RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DATA STRUCTURE UNDERSTANDING:
   ✅ 15 years of final season outcomes (GW 38)
   ✅ 5 gameweeks of current season progression (GW 3-7)
   ❌ No historical week-by-week progression (GW 1-37 for past seasons)

2. RECOMMENDED MODELING APPROACHES:
   A. Final Standings Prediction:
      - Use GW 7 form to predict final GW 38 outcome
      - Train on 15 years of historical benchmarks
      - Compare current teams vs historical final positions

   B. Next Match Prediction:
      - Use current form (GW 7) to predict upcoming matches
      - Historical GW 38 provides team quality indicators

3. TRAIN-TEST SPLIT STRATEGY:
   ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Account for multi-season structure
   ✅ Option A: Train on 2010-2023, validate on 2024, test on 2025
   ✅ Option B: Leave-one-season-out cross-validation
   ❌ DO NOT: Random shuffle across seasons

4. NEXT STEPS:
   - Proceed to Part 1B: Goals Analysis
   - Continue exploratory analysis through Parts 1C-1H
   - Begin feature engineering focused on GW 7 → GW 38 prediction
   - Address critical data quality issues found
