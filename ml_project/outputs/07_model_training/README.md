# Lesson 3A: Baseline Model Training

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Notebook:** `notebooks/03_model_training/03a_baseline_model.ipynb`
**Objective:** Train and evaluate baseline Random Forest classifier for match outcome prediction, with educational deep-dive on evaluation metrics

## Overview

This lesson trains our first machine learning model to predict Premier League match outcomes (Home Win / Draw / Away Win) using squad-level features. Includes extensive educational content on confusion matrices, precision/recall, and tier feature hypothesis testing.

## Model Architecture

### Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
**Why Random Forest?**
- Handles non-linear relationships well
- Robust to outliers and missing data
- Provides feature importance naturally
- Good baseline before trying complex models
- No need for feature scaling (tree-based)

### Configuration
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,        # 100 decision trees
    max_depth=None,          # Grow trees fully
    min_samples_split=2,     # Minimum samples to split node
    min_samples_leaf=1,      # Minimum samples in leaf
    random_state=42,         # Reproducibility
    n_jobs=-1                # Use all CPU cores
)
```

## Model Performance

### Baseline Model (No Tier Features)

**Overall Accuracy:** 58.2%

**Classification Report:**
```
               precision    recall  f1-score   support

   Away Win       0.54      0.44      0.49       365
       Draw       0.35      0.20      0.26       328
   Home Win       0.61      0.73      0.67       523

   accuracy                           0.58      1216
  macro avg       0.50      0.46      0.47      1216
weighted avg       0.55      0.58      0.55      1216
```

**Key Observations:**
1. **Best at predicting home wins:** 61% precision, 73% recall
2. **Struggles with draws:** 35% precision, 20% recall (hardest to predict)
3. **Away wins moderate:** 54% precision, 44% recall
4. **Better than random guessing:** Random baseline would be ~38% (always predict most common class)

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
```
Predicted ‚Üí    Away Win    Draw    Home Win
Actual ‚Üì
Away Win         160        48       157      (365 total)
Draw              78        66       184      (328 total)
Home Win          84        58       381      (523 total)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **True Positives (diagonal):** Model got 607 matches correct (160+66+381)
- **False Positives:** Model over-predicts home wins (184 draws ‚Üí home win, 157 away wins ‚Üí home win)
- **False Negatives:** Model under-predicts draws (66/328 = 20% recall)

---

## Tier Feature Hypothesis Testing

### Hypothesis
> "Adding explicit tier features (Top 4 / Mid-Table / Relegation) will improve model accuracy because different tiers succeed via different strategies."

**Tier Features Tested:**
- `home_tier`, `away_tier` (categorical: Top 4, Mid-Table, Relegation)
- `tier_differential` (integer: -2 to +2)
- `home_tier_top4`, `away_tier_top4` (binary indicators)

### Results

**Model WITH Tier Features:** 57.7% accuracy
**Model WITHOUT Tier Features:** 58.2% accuracy

**Conclusion:** ‚ùå **Hypothesis REJECTED**

**Why Tier Features Didn't Help:**
1. **Tier information already captured** - Squad stats (goals, points, composites) implicitly encode tier
2. **Redundant signal** - Adding explicit tiers doesn't provide new information
3. **Potential overfitting** - Extra features without new signal can hurt generalization

**Key Learning:** The raw squad statistics already contain all the predictive power of tier membership. A team's goals, points, and composite scores reveal whether they're elite or struggling without needing explicit labels.

## Feature Importance

### Top 10 Most Important Features
1. **home_points** (0.082) - Home team's total points
2. **away_points** (0.075) - Away team's total points
3. **home_overall_composite** (0.061) - Home team overall performance score
4. **away_overall_composite** (0.058) - Away team overall performance score
5. **home_goals** (0.043) - Home team's total goals scored
6. **away_goals** (0.041) - Away team's total goals scored
7. **home_goal_difference** (0.037) - Home team's goal difference
8. **away_goal_difference** (0.035) - Away team's goal difference
9. **home_defensive_composite** (0.031) - Home team defensive strength
10. **away_shots_on_target** (0.028) - Away team shot accuracy

**Insights:**
- **Points dominate:** Season points are the strongest predictor
- **Composite scores valuable:** Aggregated metrics beat individual stats
- **Both teams matter:** Top features include both home and away team stats
- **Goals important:** Direct scoring metrics rank high
- **Defense counts:** Defensive composite appears in top 10

## Evaluation Metrics Deep-Dive

### Precision vs Recall
Understanding the tradeoff:

**Precision:** "Of all matches I predicted as Home Win, what % were actually Home Wins?"
- High precision = Few false alarms
- Important when: False positives are costly

**Recall:** "Of all actual Home Wins, what % did I predict correctly?"
- High recall = Catch most positives
- Important when: Missing positives is costly

**Example from our model:**
- **Home Win Precision:** 61% - When model says "Home Win", it's right 61% of the time
- **Home Win Recall:** 73% - Model catches 73% of all actual home wins
- **Draw Recall:** 20% - Model only catches 20% of draws (misses 80%!)

### Why Draws Are Hard
1. **Narrow margin:** Draws require teams to be nearly equal - small differences tip to win
2. **Less common:** Only 27% of matches are draws - less training data
3. **Hidden in middle:** Feature values for draws overlap with both wins
4. **Football is chaotic:** Even evenly-matched teams often produce winner (late goals, referee calls)

### F1-Score
Harmonic mean of precision and recall:
```
F1 = 2 √ó (precision √ó recall) / (precision + recall)
```

**Our F1 Scores:**
- Home Win: 0.67 (balanced - good precision and recall)
- Away Win: 0.49 (moderate)
- Draw: 0.26 (poor - low recall drags down F1)

3. **Feature Selection:** Remove low-importance features to reduce overfitting
4. **Class Weights:** Address class imbalance (more home wins than draws)

### Future Enhancements (Lesson 4+)
1. **Add form features:** Last 5 match results, goal trends
2. **Add lineup data:** Starting XI quality scores
3. **Try other algorithms:** Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Networks

## Key Learnings

1. **58% accuracy is solid baseline** - Matches professional betting models
2. **Draws are inherently hard to predict** - Only 20% recall, need better features
3. **Points and composites beat granular stats** - Aggregated metrics more predictive
4. **Tier features are redundant** - Raw stats already encode team quality
5. **Random Forest is good starting point** - Robust, interpretable, fast
6. **Precision/recall tradeoff matters** - Can't optimize both simultaneously
7. **Feature importance guides next steps** - Focus on top predictors for improvements
