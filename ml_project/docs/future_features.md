# Future Features & Enhancements

## Phase 2: Lineup-Based Predictions (Lesson 4)

### Objective
Enhance match predictor with starting XI data for improved accuracy.

### Data Requirements
1. Scrape lineup data from FBRef
   - Starting XI per match
   - Substitutions
   - Player minutes played
   
2. Add `match_lineups` table to DuckDB
   - Schema: match_id, team_id, player_id, position, is_starter, minutes

3. Link lineups to match outcomes
   - Join match_lineups ‚Üí analytics_fixtures
   - Calculate starting XI aggregate stats per match

### Feature Engineering
1. **Lineup Quality Score**
   - Sum of starting XI player ratings
   - Compare home XI quality vs away XI quality
   
2. **Key Player Presence**
   - Binary: Is team's top scorer starting?
   - Binary: Is team's best defender starting?
   
3. **Squad Rotation Indicator**
   - Changes from previous match lineup
   - Fatigue indicator (minutes in last 7 days)

4. **Position-Specific Matchups**
   - Home striker quality vs away defense quality
   - Home midfield vs away midfield

### ML Model Enhancement
- Train model with lineup features
- Compare accuracy: squad-only vs squad+lineup
- Expected improvement: +3-5% accuracy

### Dashboard Feature: Manual Lineup Entry
```
[Arsenal ‚ñº]  vs  [Chelsea ‚ñº]

‚òë Manually Enter Lineups

Arsenal Starting XI:
GK:  [Ramsdale ‚ñº]
DEF: [Saliba ‚ñº] [Gabriel ‚ñº] [White ‚ñº] [Zinchenko ‚ñº]
MID: [Rice ‚ñº] [Odegaard ‚ñº] [Havertz ‚ñº]
FWD: [Saka ‚ñº] [Jesus ‚ñº] [Martinelli ‚ñº]

[PREDICT MATCH]
```

**Output:**
- Win probability with lineup adjustment
- Key lineup advantages/disadvantages
- Predicted score with lineup context

### Success Criteria
- Lineup features improve model accuracy by ‚â•3%
- Manual lineup entry works smoothly in dashboard
- Predictions update in real-time when lineup changes

## Phase 3: Auto-Populated Lineups (Lesson 6+)

### Objective
Automatically predict likely lineups based on patterns.

### Data Requirements
1. Historical lineup data (Phase 2 requirement)
2. Injury/suspension data (new scraping needed)
3. Press conference hints (optional, advanced)

### Approach
Train a "lineup prediction model":
- Input: Recent starting XI, injuries, opponent strength, competition
- Output: Predicted starting XI for next match

### Integration
- User clicks "Auto-fill Lineups"
- System predicts both teams' starting XIs
- User can review/edit before predicting match

## Phase 4: Player-vs-Player Matchups (Advanced)

### Objective
Model individual positional battles.

### Examples
- Haaland vs Van Dijk
- Saka vs Cucurella
- Odegaard vs Casemiro

### Approach
- Extract player pairwise stats when they face each other
- Train model: (player_A_stats, player_B_stats) ‚Üí outcome
- Aggregate all 22 player matchups ‚Üí team prediction

### Complexity
HIGH - requires significant data engineering and advanced ML.

## Other Future Ideas

### 1. Live Match Updates
- Update predictions in real-time as match progresses
- Adjust based on goals, red cards, subs

### 2. Historical "What-If" Analysis
- "What if Arsenal had started Nketiah instead of Jesus?"
- Retroactively test lineup decisions

### 3. Optimal Lineup Recommender
- "Which starting XI maximizes win probability vs Chelsea?"
- Try all lineup permutations, rank by predicted outcome

### 4. Injury Impact Quantification
- "Arsenal loses 8% win probability without Saka"
- Quantify each player's impact on team performance
