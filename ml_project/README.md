# Premier League ML Project

Machine learning experimentation and model development for Premier League match prediction.

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
- `outputs/`: Generated charts, reports, and analysis results
- `data/`: ML-specific data artifacts (processed datasets, features, splits)
- `models/`: Saved trained models (future)
- `scripts/`: Reusable ML utility functions (future)

## Current Status
- [x] Lesson 1A: Initial data inspection
- [ ] Lesson 1B-H: Remaining exploratory analysis
- [ ] Lesson 2: Feature engineering
- [ ] Lessons 3+: Model development
