## Fixture-Based Gameweek System

### How It Works
The system calculates gameweeks **per team** based on completed fixtures, not a single global gameweek.

**Key Concept**: 
- Each team's gameweek = `MAX(gameweek)` where their fixtures have `is_completed = true`
- Different teams can be at different gameweeks simultaneously
- Raw data has NO gameweek column (gameweek assigned in analytics layer)

### Data Flow
```
1. Scraper ‚Üí Fixtures table (with is_completed flag)
2. Analytics ETL ‚Üí Calculate team gameweeks from fixtures
3. Consolidation ‚Üí Assign each record its team's gameweek
4. SCD Processor ‚Üí Update only teams with new data
5. Master Pipeline ‚Üí Compare team-by-team to detect updates
```

### Real-World Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Postponement**
```
Situation: Man City vs Burnley (GW6) postponed
Result in Analytics:
  - Man City: gameweek = 5, matches_played = 5
  - Burnley: gameweek = 5, matches_played = 5
  - Other 18 teams: gameweek = 6, matches_played = 6
```

**Scenario 2: Mid-Gameweek Scraping**
```
Situation: Scrape on Saturday (10 teams played, 10 haven't)
Result in Analytics:
  - 10 teams completed GW6: gameweek = 6
  - 10 teams not yet played GW6: gameweek = 5
Next scrape: System updates only the 10 teams that completed GW6
```

**Scenario 3: Rescheduled Match**
```
Situation: Man City plays postponed GW6 match
Master Pipeline Detection:
  Raw: Man City now at GW6
  Analytics: Man City still at GW5
  Decision: Update only Man City (not other 19 teams)
```

### Why This Approach?

**Old System (Single Global Gameweek)**:
- Used ONE number for ALL teams
- Broke with postponements
- Couldn't handle mid-gameweek scraping
- Updated all 20 teams even if only 1 had new data

**New System (Team-Specific Gameweeks)**:
- Each team has their own gameweek based on fixtures
- Handles postponements naturally
- Accurate during mid-gameweek scraping
- Only updates teams with new completed fixtures
- Matches real-world Premier League complexity

## Data Architecture

### Two-Database System
- **Raw Database** (`premierleague_raw.duckdb`): Preserves original FBRef structure (33 tables)
- **Analytics Database** (`premierleague_analytics.duckdb`): Unified analytics with SCD Type 2 (4 tables)

### Unified Analytics Tables
**Complete Entity Coverage:**
- **`analytics_players`**: 154 columns, outfield player statistics
- **`analytics_keepers`**: 64 columns, goalkeeper-specific metrics
- **`analytics_squads`**: 185 columns, team-level analytics  
- **`analytics_opponents`**: 185 columns, opposition analysis

### SCD Type 2 Implementation
- **Complete historical tracking** across all entity types (players, keepers, squads, opponents)
- **Transfer detection and impact analysis** with automatic squad change tracking
- **Performance progression** tracking over time for all entities
- **Dynamic season detection** with proper historical versioning
- **Unified SCD processor** handles all entity types consistently

## Pipeline Details

### Master Pipeline Intelligence (Team-Specific Mode)

The master pipeline compares gameweeks **team-by-team** rather than globally:

```bash
python pipelines/master_pipeline.py --status
```

**Example Output**:
```
üìä Current Status:
   Raw data: GW5-6 across 20 teams (2 teams behind)
   Analytics data: GW5-5 across 20 teams
   Teams needing update: Man City (GW5‚Üí6), Burnley (GW5‚Üí6)
   Refresh needed: ‚úÖ Yes (2 teams)
```

**Decision Logic**:
1. Calculate team gameweeks from raw_fixtures
2. Get current team gameweeks from analytics_players
3. Compare team-by-team:
   ```python
   for team in all_teams:
       if raw_gw[team] > analytics_gw[team]:
           teams_to_update.append(team)
   ```
4. If any teams need updating ‚Üí run analytics pipeline
5. SCD processor marks ONLY those teams as historical

**Efficiency Example**:
```
Scenario: Man City completes postponed match
Raw: 19 teams at GW6, Man City at GW6 (was GW5)
Analytics: 19 teams at GW6, Man City at GW5
Master Pipeline: Detects only Man City needs update
Analytics Pipeline: Updates only Man City (skip other 19 teams)
SCD Processor: Marks only Man City GW5 as historical
```

### Raw Pipeline
Scrapes data from FBRef using the proven "archive pattern":

```bash
# Normal operation
python pipelines/raw_pipeline.py

# Check status without running
python pipelines/raw_pipeline.py --status

# Force refresh even if current
python pipelines/raw_pipeline.py --force
```

**Features:**
- Scrapes all 33 FBRef stat tables (11 categories √ó 3 entity types)
- Automatic gameweek detection from fixtures
- Rate limiting with respectful delays (10 seconds between requests)
- Archive-pattern data cleaning (proven method)
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Note on Gameweek Tagging**:
The raw pipeline stores fixtures with completion status but does NOT tag stat tables with gameweeks. You'll see this in the logs:
```
‚úÖ 33 tables populated
üí° NOTE: Raw data stored WITHOUT gameweek tagging
   Gameweek assignment will happen in analytics layer
```

This is intentional. Gameweeks are calculated dynamically in the analytics layer based on each team's completed fixtures.

### Unified Analytics Pipeline
Processes raw data into clean analytics tables with SCD Type 2 across all entity types:

```bash
# Normal operation
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py

# Force complete refresh
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --force

# Status check
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --status

# Validation only (no data processing)
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --validate
```

**Unified ETL Process:**
1. **Team Gameweek Calculation**: Calculate each team's gameweek from raw_fixtures
2. **Data Consolidation**: Uses single `DataConsolidator` for all entity types
3. **Gameweek Assignment**: Assign team-specific gameweeks to each record
4. **SCD Processing**: Group by gameweek, process each group separately
5. **Historical Marking**: Mark only updated teams as historical (not all teams)
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive data quality checks

**Pipeline Output Example:**
```
‚úÖ Consolidated 464 total entities
   - Outfield: 398 players
   - Goalkeepers: 26 players
   - Squads: 20 squads
   - Opponents: 20 opponents
üéØ Gameweeks assigned: GW6 (all teams aligned)
‚úÖ All SCD Type 2 processing completed
üîç Analytics data validation passed
üéâ ETL Pipeline completed successfully in 1.3s
```

## Understanding Gameweek Behavior

### What You'll See in Analytics

**Query Example**:
```sql
SELECT squad, gameweek, COUNT(*) as players
FROM analytics_players
WHERE is_current = true
GROUP BY squad, gameweek
ORDER BY gameweek, squad;
```

**Normal Result (All Teams Aligned)**:
```
Arsenal: GW6, 20 players
Brighton: GW6, 19 players
Chelsea: GW6, 22 players
...
(All 20 teams at GW6)
```

**Result During Postponement**:
```
Man City: GW5, 20 players     ‚Üê Postponed GW6
Burnley: GW5, 19 players      ‚Üê Postponed GW6
Arsenal: GW6, 20 players
Brighton: GW6, 19 players
...
(18 teams at GW6, 2 teams at GW5)
```

### Common Questions

**Q: Why do teams have different gameweeks?**
A: Real-world postponements, rescheduling, or mid-gameweek scraping. This is accurate behavior.

**Q: Will teams "catch up" eventually?**
A: Yes. When postponed matches are played and you re-scrape, those teams' gameweeks will increment.

**Q: Does this affect historical data?**
A: Yes, positively. Each team's historical records reflect their actual match progression, not a fake global gameweek.

**Q: What about matches_played vs gameweek?**
A: They should be equal or close (within 1-2). Large differences indicate data quality issues or players who haven't played much.

## Configuration Management

### Core Configuration Files

#### sources.yaml
Maps FBRef URLs to stat categories:
```yaml
stats_sources:
  standard:
    url: "https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/stats/Premier-League-Stats"
    tables: ["squad_standard", "opponent_standard", "player_standard"]
  shooting:
    url: "https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/shooting/Premier-League-Stats"
    tables: ["squad_shooting", "opponent_shooting", "player_shooting"]
```

#### scraping.yaml
Controls scraping behavior:
```yaml
scraping:
  delays:
    between_requests: 10  # Respectful to FBRef
    connection_timeout: 30
  retries:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_factor: 2
```

#### database.yaml
Database paths and settings:
```yaml
database:
  paths:
    raw: "data/premierleague_raw.duckdb"
    analytics: "data/premierleague_analytics.duckdb"
  backup:
    enabled: true
    retention_days: 30
```

#### pipeline.yaml
Pipeline orchestration settings:
```yaml
pipeline:
  master:
    timeout_raw: 1800      # 30 minutes
    timeout_analytics: 600 # 10 minutes
  analytics:
    scd_processing: true
    validation_enabled: true
```

## Error Handling & Logging

### Enhanced Logging
All pipelines use timestamped, rotated logging:

```bash
# View recent logs
ls -la data/logs/

# Example log files
master_pipeline_20250920_140151.log
analytics_pipeline_20250920_140155.log
raw_pipeline_20250920_140130.log
```

### Error Recovery
- **Non-critical errors**: Pipeline continues with warnings
- **Critical errors**: Pipeline stops with detailed error messages
- **Timeout handling**: Reasonable timeouts for each pipeline stage
- **Retry logic**: Built-in retry for transient failures
- **Validation gates**: Comprehensive checks before committing data

## Advanced Usage

### Force Operations
```bash
# Force only raw pipeline (useful for FBRef updates)
python pipelines/master_pipeline.py --force-raw

# Force only analytics pipeline (useful for schema changes)
python pipelines/master_pipeline.py --force-analytics

# Force both pipelines (complete refresh)
python pipelines/master_pipeline.py --force-all
```

### Status Monitoring
```bash
# System-wide status with entity counts
python pipelines/master_pipeline.py --status

# Individual pipeline detailed status
python pipelines/raw_pipeline.py --status
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --status

# Quick validation check
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --validate
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make code changes in `src/`
2. Test with `--dry-run` to preview
3. Run with `--force-all` to test changes
4. Validate with `python scripts/validate_analytics_system.py`
5. Check logs in `data/logs/` for detailed output

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors after updates**: 
```bash
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
```

**Database connection issues**: 
Check paths in `config/database.yaml`

**Scraping failures**: 
Check internet connection and FBRef availability

**SCD validation failures**: 
```bash
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --force
```

**Missing analytics tables**: 
```bash
python scripts/create_analytics_db.py
```

### Gameweek-Related Issues

**Teams at different gameweeks**:
- **Not an error**: This is normal during postponements or mid-gameweek scraping
- **Verify**: Check `raw_fixtures` table for `is_completed` status
- **Expected**: System will align once all teams play their matches

**Pipeline says "Teams needing update" but gameweeks look aligned**:
- **Cause**: You may have scraped mid-processing of a gameweek
- **Fix**: Re-run `python pipelines/master_pipeline.py` - it will detect no updates needed
- **Prevention**: Run pipeline after gameweeks are fully complete

**Historical records missing for some teams**:
- **Cause**: SCD processor only marks updated teams as historical
- **Expected**: Teams without new data keep their current records
- **Not a bug**: This is efficient selective processing

**Matches_played doesn't match gameweek**:
- **Normal**: Rotation players, substitutes, injured players have fewer matches
- **Check**: Look at MAX(matches_played) per team, not individual players
- **Issue only if**: MAX(matches_played) > gameweek (player played more matches than team completed)

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check system health
python pipelines/master_pipeline.py --status

# Validate without processing
python pipelines/analytics_pipeline.py --validate

# Full system validation
python scripts/validate_analytics_system.py

# Check recent pipeline logs
tail -f data/logs/master_pipeline_*.log
```

## Performance Tips

- **Use master pipeline**: More efficient than running individual pipelines
- **Monitor log file sizes**: Logs rotate automatically but check disk space
- **Regular validation**: Run validation weekly to catch data quality issues early
- **Database optimization**: Analytics database automatically optimizes queries with proper indexing
